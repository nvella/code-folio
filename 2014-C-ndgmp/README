                                     NDGMP

NDGMP (Nick's Distributed Game-Of-Life Mining Protocol) is a distributed
pattern mining system for Conway's Game-Of-Life. The aim of this system is to
discover new patterns for GOL which bear special properties. There is no
scientific value in this system, only fun. :D

The NDGMP system contains two major components. The 'miner', a machine
running NDGMP patterning mining software, and the 'pool', a machine which
co-ordinates and hands out new jobs to the miners.

This document will describe the protocol used to communicate between the miner
and the pool.
