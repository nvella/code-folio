# NCSS Advanced Challenge 2017

In 2017 I participated in and placed first in the NCSS Advanced Challenge, a
nation-wide Python programming competition. The competition consisted of 26
Python programming problems, spread over five weeks. For each of these problems,
I was required to develop a working solution within five submissions, which I
acheived successfully.

The last two weeks of the competition saw the most complex problems presented, and I have collated my solutions to them here. See below for a table of a brief
description of each problem; for copyright reasoning I cannot include the
original problem texts.

## Problem summaries
|Problem|Title|Summary|
|-------|-----|-----------|
|Week 4, Problem 1|The Cover Of Knight|Given dimensions of a chess board, a start position and a move limit, output an ASCII chess board where each square is a number stating how many moves are required for a knight to reach that square from the starting position, or a period (```.```) if a knight cannot reach that square in the set number of moves.|
|Week 4, Problem 2|Interleavings|Given two strings, generate a list of all unique interleavings in alphabetical order.|
|Week 4, Problem 3|Predicting Text|Class representing a node in a predictive text tree system.|
|Week 4, Problem 4|Pac-Man (I)|Simple Pac-Man-like game with the ghost AI implementing a breadth-first path-finding algortihm.|
|Week 4, Problem 5|Expand This|Given a Reverse Polish Notation algebraic expression, expand the expression and output the terms of the resultant polynomial in decreasing order of the power of the pronumeral.|
|Week 5, Problem 1|Patches of Paint|Parse a text file containing a ASCII representation of 'paint patches on the ground'. Find and output the number of distinct patches of paint in the file.|
|Week 5, Problem 2|Unmasked|For each of the text files listed in ```texts.txt```, compare the cosine simularity of the word lengths in that specific file and ```unknown.txt```, outputing these values to the terminal alongside the name of the text file being checked.|
|Week 5, Problem 3|Degree Distribution|Process a list of degrees and student preferences, outputting a list of degrees with ranking score cutoffs, whether or not the degree still has positions available, and the number of students offered positions in the degree, as-well as a list of students with their raw scores and the degree they were offered.|
|Week 5, Problem 4|Pac-Man (II)|Similar to Pac-Man (I), except ghosts now do not consume pac-dots.|
|Week 5, Problem 5|Pigpen Cipher|Decode inconsistenly sized pigpen cipher glyphs displayed in a PNG file.|
